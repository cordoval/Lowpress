The idea:
Seamlessly integrate symfony2 with other popular systems to create a highly flexible system that has full access to plugin and module repositories for all systems.

Blog the progress on the system itself.


The task list:
* Have Symfony2 and wordpress run alongside eachother
* Change wordpress to use Twig templates, ensuring that additional wordpress plugins can be installed and still work
* Make sure symfony actions can be included within the context of wordpress templates and wordpress plugins can be included within the context of symfony2 pages
* Replace 'Pages' in wordpress with a symfony2 based CMS system
